# SIM900 GSM Switch using a raspberry pi

This code talks to a SIM900 module over the serial port.  It uses the module to send and receive text messages for the purpose of controlling one more more switches.  I use this to turn a preheater on and off for my airplane, but it probably has other uses too :-)
